    bio: |
        Richard is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, where he has been on the faculty since 1986, with brief leaves to [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/), [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com), and PATH. His research has focussed on computing for the developing world since 2005, when he became involved with the Digital Study Hall project. In 2009, Richard spent a sabbatical year working with the [Digital Health Solutions](http://sites.path.org/hmis/) group at PATH, a global health NGO based in Seattle. This opportunity allowed him to increase his efforts on applying computing technologies to challenges in global health. While working with PATH, he co-founded the Projecting Health project, which uses the Community-Led Video Education model to promote healthy practices in rural areas in India. Back at University of Washington, he oversaw the efforts of the Open Data Kit project. His research interests in ICTD include technologies for behavior change communication, improving tools to support the use of data in strengthening health systems, and digital financial services.

        Kurtis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. He received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley where he worked on Commmunity Cellular Networks: low-cost, low-power, locally owned cellular infrastructure. After Berkeley he co-founded [Endaga](http://endaga.com) to commercialize the work on Community Cellular and joined Facebook to continue that effort. His research focuses primarily on access, continuing to build and evaluate Community Cellular networks the world over, in partnership with organizations such as Rhizomatica, Facebook, and others. He is a developer on [CommunityCellularManager](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CommunityCellularManager) and a close partner with Facebook's [OpenCellular](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1754757044806180/introducing-opencellular-an-open-source-wireless-access-platform). Beyond access he also is interested broadly in cellular. Some examples projects include countering "Stingray" IMSI-catcher devices and lower-power communications.

    bio: |
        Dr. Sevilla is a self-starting, fast-moving computer scientist with a record of creating innovative and award-winning solutions in the fields of computer networking and distributed systems. He is the author of thirteen peer-reviewed papers, ten US patents, has received multiple "Best Paper" awards (IFIP, ICNP) and was recently awarded a UC Presidential Fellowship. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the ICTD Lab at the University of Washington, where he works with Kurtis Heimerl on community cellular networks. Spencer's primary research interest is Internet architecture and access in developing and disconnected regions, including issues such as content distribution and caching, spectum allocation, and last-mile connectivity. His previous research interests have included content networking, mesh routing (wired and wireless), future Internet architectures, and virtual datacenter networks.

        # Waylon is a Post-Doctoral Researcher focused on designing and building resilient mobile technologies optimized for usage in resource-constrained and infrastructure-constrained environments. His research focuses on creating tools and frameworks to simplify building and managing domain-specific mobile data collection applications in environments without Internet connectivity. Waylon is one of the founders of the Open Data Kit (ODK) project and is a current member of the core development team and management committee of ODK-X. Waylon’s research interests include mobile systems, sensing, ubiquitous computing, and data management. His work focuses on designing systems that improve the lives of under-served populations in low-income regions by leveraging mobile computing devices and sensors. Waylon is interested in using devices, sensors, services, and interfaces to create computer systems that integrate seamlessly into a user’s environment allowing technology to fade into the background of daily life. Waylon is a former NSF graduate fellow and previously worked as a Research Scientist/Engineer for the University of Washington focused on mobile computing, ubiquitous computing, and sensor networks in collaboration with Intel Labs Seattle.

        Gaetano was faculty member at UW-CSE from 1988 - 2015. He passed away on February 1, 2015 
        following a long fight with cancer. He was directing efforts in applying mobile technologies 
        to the problems of public health and development in low-resource settings. He led development of 
        open-source mobile data collection tools, Open Data Kit, that are in use on six continents in 
        programs ranging across public health, documentation of human rights violations, and environmental monitoring.
