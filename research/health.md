### Global Health
An important domain for ICTD research is investigating how computing and information technologies can help address the challenges in improving global health.  This ranges from developing tools that improve the ability of front line health workers to diagnose diseases to working on systems that strengthen reporting of health data that allows better decision making.  Work conducted by the group is done in close partnership with organization with expertise in global health such as PATH and the UW Department of Global Health.

Projects in global health include mPneumonia and Projecting Health in collaboration with PATH, an MWach in collaboration with the Department of Global Health.  Recent graduates Nicki Dell developed ODK Diagnostics as part of her dissertation work, and Rohit Chaudhuri led work on the FoneAstra system which has been used to monitor pasteurization for Human Milk Banking.
