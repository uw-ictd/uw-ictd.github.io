## Old Courses
[Undergraduate reading seminar, Technology for the Developing World - Digital Financial Services, CSE490D:](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse490d/16wi/) 
Winter quarter, 2016 we offered a 1-credit, undergraduate reading seminar on technology in the developing world, with an emphasis on digital financial services.  The purpose of the seminar was to provide an introduction to a research area at the intersection of computer science and global development. 

Gender in ICTD &amp; HCI Research, CSE 599:
This graduate seminar explores the topic of gender as related to computer science research, especially in the fields of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will engage in close readings of foundational texts on gender, as well as the emerging ICTD and HCI literature that uses gender analysis as a framework for research in both the West and in resource-constrained regions of the world. Through discussion and written assignments students will build a strong foundation for incorporating gender analysis into their research. They will also be able to more effectively evaluate the current work being conducted in the fields of ICTD and HCI as related to gender. Some of the topics under consideration will include gender as related to feminist HCI, design, health and safety, financial services, and mobile technologies and connectivity.  Last offered Winter 2018.

\(Last offered, Spring 2014\) CSE 490D/481K is a two-quarter-long design and implementation sequence. In winter, students form project groups to scope and design projects for resource-constrained environments. In the spring quarter students implement and evaluate the projects that were started in the winter. The emphasis is on group work leading to the creation of testable realizations and completion of initial evaluations of the software and hardware artifacts produced. Students work in with a faculty or graduate student manager.
